\chapter{Inter-domain Path Computation problem under the Domain Uniqueness constraint}
\label{chap:chap2}
Chapter~\ref{chap:chap2} introduces the \acrfull{idpcdu} as well as its real-world applications. Besides, the problem statement and its constraint are also described carefully for a better comprehensibility. Finally, previous studies that solved the \gls{idpcdu} were also synthesized.
