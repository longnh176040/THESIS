To evaluate the performance of the proposed \acrshort{gaco}, 
we utilize the public dataset generated in~\cite{binh2020multifactorial} for \gls{idpcdu} to evaluate the performance of the proposed \acrshort{gaco}. 
%The dataset consists of a small set with nodes ranging from 10 to 45 and a large group with 50 to 100.
This dataset comprises two sets of instances, including a small set, where the number of nodes ranges from 10 to 45 with an increment of 5, and a large one, where the number of nodes varies from 50 to 100 with an increment of 10.
The number of domains corresponding to each instance is generated by multiplying the number of nodes by a ratio of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. Details of the dataset are available in~\cite{idpcdu2020data}.
